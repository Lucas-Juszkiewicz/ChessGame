# Chess Application (Java)

Welcome to the Chess Application, an ongoing project created in Java as part of a programming learning journey. 
As of now, the backend has been developed to enable the movement of pawns on the chessboard. 
While the project remains a work in progress, the 'main' function provides an illustrative example of the game's initial setup, 
showcasing the functionality through various implemented methods.

## Features:
- Backend functionality for pawn movement.
- Example demonstration of the game's starting position.
- Symbolic visualization of the chessboard in the terminal.

## Project Status:
- User interaction has not been implemented yet.
- The project is incomplete, with room for expansion and additional features.

## Getting Started:
To explore the current state of the Chess Application, navigate to the 'main' function in the code to see a demonstration of the pawn movements and the initial game setup.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. Explore the terminal to observe the symbolic representation of the chessboard.

Have fun and have a good day :)
